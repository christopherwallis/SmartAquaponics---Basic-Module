# SmartAquaponics
Low level module used to control aquaponics system. 
- Controls system behaviour (pump time etc) based on sensor data (battery, moisture, light) and data collected from external sources. 
- Designed to run autonomously if sensors fail or conectivity is lost to higher level modules / server. 
- Sensor data and system behavior is passed to higher level modules and recorded on server for analytics.
